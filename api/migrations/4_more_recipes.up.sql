    '1. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, mustard, salt, pepper, and honey, if using.
2. Drizzle in the olive oil while whisking and continue to whisk until the dressing is emulsified. Alternatively, combine everything in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake to combine.
3. If your dressing is too tangy, add more olive oil, to taste.
4. Add the thyme, if desired, and season to taste. Store in the fridge for up to 1 week. The olive oil will solidify a bit in the fridge. To soften, let the dressing sit at room temp for a few minutes and stir before using.
