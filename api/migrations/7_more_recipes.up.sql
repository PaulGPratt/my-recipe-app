  '1. 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 packed cups (about 2 big bunches) fresh basil leaves
* 1 to 2 garlic cloves, finely grated or pounded with a pinch of salt
* 1/2 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted and pounded
* 3 1/2 ounces Parmesan, finely grated, plus more for serving (about 1 heaping cup)
* Salt',
  '1. The key to blending basil in a machine is to avoid overdoing it, because the heat the motor generates, along with oxidation that can occur from overchopping, will cause the basil to turn brown.
2. Give yourself a head start here, and run a knife through the basil first. Also pour half of the olive oil into the bottom of the blender or processor bowl to encourage the basil to break down into a liquid as quickly as possible.
3. Then pulse, stopping to push down the leaves with a rubber spatula a couple of times a minute, until the basil becomes a fragrant, emerald-green whirlpool.
4. To prevent overblending the basil, finish the pesto in a bowl. Pour the basil oil out into a medium bowl, and add some of the garlic, pine nuts, and Parmesan. Stir to combine, then taste.
5. Does it need more garlic? More salt? More cheese? Is it too thick? If so, add a little more oil, or plan to add some pasta water.
6. Tinker and taste again, keeping in mind that as the pesto sits for a little while, the flavors will come together, the garlic will become more pronounced, and the salt will dissolve.
7. Let it sit for a few minutes, then taste and adjust again. Add enough olive oil to cover the sauce to prevent oxidation.
8. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.',
