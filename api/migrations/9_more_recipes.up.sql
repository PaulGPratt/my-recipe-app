  '1. 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1/3 cup (80g) plain yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature
* 2 cups (460g) mashed bananas (about 4 large ripe bananas)
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* Optional: 3/4 cup (100g) chopped pecans or walnuts',
  '1. Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a metal 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.
2. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
3. Using a handheld or stand mixer, beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy (about 2 minutes). With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
4. Beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until combined.
5. With the mixer on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts if using.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, loosely covering the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown.
7. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. Begin checking after 60 minutes.
8. Remove bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan on a wire rack for 1 hour. Remove from the pan and cool completely before slicing.',

  '1. 1 and 1/3 cups (170g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 1/2 cup (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar
* 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar, plus 1/2 cup (100g) for rolling
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 3/4 cup (about 185g) creamy peanut butter
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract',
  '1. Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed for 1 minute until creamy. Add the brown sugar and 1/4 cup granulated sugar and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and smooth, about 2 minutes.
3. Add the egg and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the peanut butter and vanilla extract and beat until combined.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low speed until combined. The dough will be very creamy and soft. Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1–2 hours (up to 3 days).
5. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
6. Place remaining 1/2 cup of sugar in a bowl. Roll chilled dough into balls (about 1 tablespoon each), roll in sugar, and place on baking sheets 2 inches apart. Use a fork to make a criss-cross indent on each cookie. Reshape into a thicker disc if needed.
7. Bake for 11–12 minutes or until edges appear set and are lightly browned. Centers will still look very soft.
8. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.',
