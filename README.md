# Recipe App

This is a custom recipe app, built primarily for my wife, who is a low-vision individual. The goal of the app is to provide an easy-to-use, mobile-friendly platform for accessing and organizing her favorite recipes.

## Features
- **Mobile-First Design**: The UI is optimized for mobile use, ensuring a seamless experience on smartphones.
- **Accessibility Focused**: The app is designed with accessibility in mind, featuring:
  - High-contrast color schemes for better readability.
  - Larger font sizes to accommodate low-vision users.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React is used to build an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Go powers the backend, ensuring efficient performance.

## Future Plans
The app starts with a collection of my wife's favorite recipes, and future updates will include additional features based on her personal needs and feedback. This iterative approach ensures the app evolves in a way that best supports her daily use.
